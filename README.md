# CS2_HW4

You will do this homework in teams of 3-4 students.  Pick your teams and get started.  You may again work with students from HW 3, but not from HW 1 or 2.

## Introduction
In class we talked about the Towers of Hanoi problem.  One way to express the problem is to call a function MoveStack that takes in 4 arguments, the number of disks to move (assume they are in sorted order on the from spindle), the number of the from spindle, the number of the to spindle, and the number of the extra spindle.  So, we start the program for say a tower of 5 disks by calling MoveStack(5,1,3,2) (that is, move 5 disks from spindle 1 to 3 using 2 as the other spindle).

Research how one might write code to solve this problem recursively and then implement it to show what it would produce as a solution for MoveStack(5,1,3,2).

## What to Submit
Once you have completed your program submit your code via the canvas interface as a single file. Make sure that you include the names and ID#s of all of the people in your group.  Also, include a sample run of your code.
